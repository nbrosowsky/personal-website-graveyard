                                       Adjustments in cognitive control, as measured by congruency sequence effects, are thought to be influenced by both external stimuli and internal goals. However, this dichotomy has often overshadowed the potential contribution of past experience stored in memory. Here, we examine the role of long-term episodic memory in guiding selective attention. Our aim was to demonstrate new evidence that selective attention can be modulated by long-term retrieval of stimulus-specific attentional control settings. All the experiments used a modified flanker task involving multiple unique stimuli. Critically, each stimulus was only presented twice during the experiment: first as a prime, and second as a probe. Experiments 1 and 2 varied the number of intervening trials between prime and probe and manipulated the amount of conflict using a secondary task. Experiment 3 ensured that specific colors assigned to prime stimuli were not repeated when presented as probes. Across both experiments 1 and 2, we consistently found smaller congruency effects on probe trials when its associated prime trial was incongruent compared to congruent, demonstrating long-term congruency sequence effects. However, experiment 3 showed no evidence for long-term effects. These findings suggest long-term preservation of selective attention processing at the episodic level, and implicate a role for memory in updating cognitive control.

                                        Statistical learning is the general phenomenon by which environmental regularities are implicitly acquired through repeated exposure to those environments. Sometimes, that information can be utilized to affect various aspects of cognitive performance (e.g., reaction time) on tasks that utilize selective attention (e.g., visual search). In the current study, we examined the effect of passively listening to predictive auditory contexts on basic auditory perceptual tasks (e.g., judging whether a target sounds that either continuously increased/decreased in frequency, or either contained or did not contain a short 10 ms gap). In doing so, we discovered that there is a general tendency for attentional resources to be negatively affected when the context sequences are made novel after learning has occurred (Experiment 1), and when the context no longer reliably cues the previous target (Experiment 2). The experiments are framed to contrast Associative Learning and Memory Hypothesis perspectives.

                                    <p> Crump &amp; Milliken (2009) showed that Stroop effects can be modulated by context-specific cues associated with different levels of proportion congruent, even for items that appeared equally frequently in each context. This result has important theoretical implications, because it ruled out frequency-driven learning explanations of context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) effects, and left open the possibility that a cue-driven retrieval process can reinstate attentional control setting in a rapid online fashion. The purpose of the present work was to address reproducibility concerns that have been raised about this finding (Hutcheon &amp; Spieler, under review). We conducted several reproductions and novel extensions of the Crump &amp; Milliken procedures using Amazon&#39;s mechanical Turk in both Stroop and flanker tasks. We successfully replicated the major findings from prior work. We also provide new Monte Carlo simulation analyses to estimate reproducibility of the phenomena that show important limitations on these designs for measuring contextual control.

                                    <p> Recent work suggests that environmental cues associated with previous attentional control settings can rapidly and involuntarily adjust attentional priorities. The current study tests predictions from adaptive-learning and memory-based theories of contextual control about the role of intentions for setting attentional priorities. To extend the empirical boundaries of contextual control phenomena, and to determine whether theoretical principles of contextual control are generalizable we used a novel bi-dimensional stimulus sampling task. Subjects viewed briefly presented arrays of letters and colors presented above or below fixation, and identified specific stimuli according to a dimensional (letter or color) and positional cue. Location was predictive of the cued dimension, but not the position or identity. In contrast to previous findings, contextual control failed to develop through automatic, adaptive-learning processes. Instead, previous experience with intentionally changing attentional sampling priorities between different contexts was required for contextual control to develop.

                                    <p> Although visual demonstrations of multistability are ubiquitous, there are few auditory examples. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether simultaneously presented melodies, such as underlie the scale illusion (Deutsch, 1975), can elicit multiple mutually exclusive percepts, and whether reported perceptions are mediated by musical expertise. Participants listened to target melodies and reported whether the target was embedded in subsequent test melodies. Target sequences were created such that they would only be heard if the listener interpreted the test melody according to various perceptual cues. Critically, and in contrast with previous examinations of the scale illusion, an objective measure of target detection was obtained by including target-absent test melodies. As a result, listeners could reliably identify target sequences from different perceptual organizations when presented with the same test melody on different trials. This result demonstrates an ability to alternate between mutually exclusive percepts of an unchanged stimulus. However, only perceptual organizations consistent with frequency and spatial cues were available and musical expertise did mediate target detection, limiting the organizations available to non-musicians. The current study provides the first known demonstration of auditory multistability using simultaneously presented melodies and provides a unique experimental method for measuring auditory perceptual competition.

                                    <p> Three experiments are reported in which the attentional capture effect of sound disappearance was assessed. In all experiments participants were required to judge the pitch of target sounds that were preceded by one or more context sounds. In Experiments 1 and 2, targets presented in the same location as a context sound that had abruptly terminated 100 ms before its presentation, were identified better than target sounds presented in a different location. This result was obtained both when targets followed a single context sound (Experiment 1) and when targets followed pairs of dichotically-presented context sounds that terminated at different points (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 3 replicated those obtained in the previous experiments and showed that under some conditions the facilitative effect could persist at intervals longer than 100 ms. The results of these experiments suggest that under some conditions, the disappearance of a sound can capture attention.

                                <p> One of the most important goals of any undergraduate psychology program is to develop students’ ability to comprehend and critically evaluate empirical research. This chapter demonstrates the QALMRI method as an instructional strategy for teaching students how to identify, comprehend, and critically evaluate conceptually important information in an empirical article. Originally created as a framework to help students to develop scientific literacy, QALMRI is an acronym that stands for Question, Alternatives, Logic, Method, Results, and Inferences. We first provide an overview of the QALMRI method with a student-directed instruction guide; we then demonstrate a scaffolding approach for integrating the QALMRI method across different education levels. We conclude with a set of learner-centered activities designed to apply the QALMRI method with specific learning objectives.

                                    <p>The contextual properties of the environment, through learning and memory processes, can rapidly and involuntarily adjust attentional control. Contextual control is often touted as a mechanism that allows for rapid, flexible control over attention. Yet, almost paradoxically, previous examples show behavior that rigidly conforms to the environmental statistics. Here, we investigated how people might exploit different features of the environment to flexibly change between context-specific attentional control settings. In three related experiments, participants completed an arrow flanker task. The arrows were paired with three contextual cues associated with different levels of proportion congruency (100%, 50%, or 0%). Critically, the frequency unbiased items shared a feature with each of the biased sets. We found that shifting participants focus from one overlapping feature to the other modulated the size of the congruency effect for the frequency unbiased items and suggests that participants could actively change between context-specific control settings.

Across three experiments, we found that participants could learn to ignore a particular word in a Stroop task, eliminating the traditional interference effect. However, in all three experiments the interference effect re-appeared when the trained items were intermixed with untrained items, demonstrating a consistent failure of transfer. </p>

                                    <p> Gratton effects refer to the finding in selective attention tasks (e.g., Stroop, Flanker) that interference effects (incongruent minus congruent RTs) are smaller on trials immediately following an incongruent than congruent trial. Gratton effects are commonly explained by transient or reactive conflict-­induced shifts in attentional weights on trial n-­1 that carry forward to influence trial n. Separately from this short-­term influence episodic memory traces may also bind together attentional control settings associated with features of particular items that could allow for longer-­term cue-­driven reinstatement of prior attentional settings. In three related experiments, participants completed a color-­identification flanker task. Colors were presented on different images, and specific images were paired with congruent or incongruent trial types. We found that re-­presenting an image 4-­8 trials later modulated congruency effects on an item-­specific, and longer-­term basis than the traditional Gratton effect.

                                    <p> Hierarchical theories of action planning in skilled domains like typing (Logan & Crump, 2011) have proposed a distinction between inner and outer loop control processes that represent higher-order planning (outer loop) processes and lower-level motor execution (inner loop) processes. Specifically, the outer loop control processes retrieve words as plans, and serves word-level representations to the inner loop, which then translates them to individual keystrokes at the letter level. A critical implication of the dual-loop theory is that typists rely on verbal processes to control serial-ordering between finger movements. The current study tests the role of verbal processes in controlling fluent typing in three tasks manipulating verbal processing during typing. In Experiments 1 and 2, we demonstrate that typists type faster if they speak the words rather than letters. Experiments 3 and 4 show typing performance is worse under conditions where verbal processing is disrupted. In Experiment 3, typing was disrupted under several conditions of verbal suppression and in Experiment 4, under conditions of delayed auditory feedback. Taken together, these results provide supporting evidence for the dual-loop hierarchical control theory and suggests a role for verbal processes in the control of fluent typing.

                                    <p> Crump &amp; Milliken (2009) showed that Stroop effects can be modulated by context-specific cues associated with different levels of proportion congruent, even for items that appeared equally frequently in each context. This result has important theoretical implications, because it ruled out frequency-driven learning explanations of context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) effects, and left open the possibility that cue-driven retrieval process can reinstate attentional control setting in a rapid online fashion. The purpose of the present work was to address reproducibility concerns that have been raised about this finding. We conducted several replications and novels extensions of the Crump &amp; Milliken procedures using Amazon’s mechanical Turk in both Stroop and flanker tasks. We successfully replicated the major findings from prior work, and conducted new analyses of the role of sequential influences on CSPC effects that showed a critical role for context repetitions in CSPC flanker effects, but not in CSPC Stroop effects. We also provide new monte-carlo simulation analyses to estimate reproducibility of the phenomena that show important limitations on these designs for measuring contextual control.

                                    <p> Context has been shown to cue the automatic reinstatement of various psychological processes across domains. The current study investigates context-dependency in a previously unexamined aspect of cognitive control: the creation and execution of stimulus-response sets. Specifically, we investigate whether response subsets can become associated with, and retrieved by contextual cues. Over three choice reaction time experiments we found no evidence for contextual control over stimulus-response sets.

                                    <p> The contextual properties of the environment, through learning and memory processes, can rapidly and involuntarily adjust attentional control (Chun, 2000; Corballis &amp; Gratton, 2003; Crump, Gong, &amp; Milliken, 2006; Crump, Vaquero, &amp; Milliken, 2008). Still, little is know about the conditions under which contextual cueing occurs. The current study explores the obligatory nature of contextual cueing, specifically examining the role of volition in acquiring context-dependent attenitonal control. Using an attentional sampling task with location cues and proportion manipulations, Experiments 1 and 2 failed to find evidence of context dependency. In Experiment 3, participants adopted voluntary, context-dependent attention strategies and demonstrated successful context discrimination. Experiment 4 disentangles the roles of volition and contextual learning and provides some evidence for context-dependent attentional control. Taken together, these experiments challenge the obligatory nature of contextual cueing and demonstrate a case where volition is required to learn contextual contingencies.

                                    <p> Cognitive control refers to a collection of processes responsible for planning, monitoring, and adjusting behavior. In the domain of attention, one important aspect of cognitive control is the ability to selectively process task-relevant from irrelevant information. Historically, researchers have made the distinction between automatic processes that capture attention involuntarily and strategic, voluntary processes that shift attention in accordance with top-down goals (Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975; Shiffrin &amp; Schneider, 1977). However, more recent evidence has demonstrated that contextual properties of the environment, through learning and memory processes, can rapidly and involuntarily adjust attentional control settings; a kind of “automatic attentional control”. (Chun, 2000; Cohen, Fuchs, Bar-Sela, Brumberg, &amp; Magen, 1999; Corballis &amp; Gratton, 2003; Crump, Gong, &amp; Milliken, 2006; Crump, Vaquero, &amp; Milliken, 2008). Still, relatively little is known about the conditions under which contextual cuing occurs. The purpose of the current project is to investigate the constraints of context-specific attentional control.

                                    <p> Three experiments are reported in which the attentional capture effect of sound disappearance was assessed. In all experiments participants were required to judge the pitch of target sounds that were preceded by one or more context sounds. In Experiments 1 and 2, targets presented in the same location as a context sound that had abruptly terminated 100 ms before its presentation, were identified better than target sounds presented in a different location. This result was obtained both when targets followed a single context sound (Experiment 1) and when targets followed pairs of dichotically-presented context sounds that terminated at different points (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 3 replicated those obtained in the previous experiments and showed that under some conditions the facilitative effect could persist at intervals longer than 100 ms. The results of these experiments suggest that under some conditions, the disappearance of a sound can capture attention.

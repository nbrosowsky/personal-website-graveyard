                                    Hello all, 
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
    
                                    I'm in the process of updating the course materials to reflect the missed day. Below is the revised presentation schedule. For most people, this only pushes the presentation from the Monday to the Wednesday of the same week. Though, the Knowledge section has moved one week from April 9th to April 16th due to a conversion day. I've also uploaded a pdf of the full schedule in the course documents. I've also updated the course syllabus to reflect these changes. Please take the time to review the new schedule. 
                                </p>
                                <br/>

                                    Hi everyone!
                                </p>
                                <br/>

                                <p>
                                    I just received the alert that Brooklyn College is closing at 3 pm today, so class is officially cancelled. The schedule now is going to be pushed back one day. So on Monday, we will have the lecture we would have had today and Wednesday will be the presentations. I will update the syllabus/website/due dates etc.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p><strong>About Test 1...</strong>

                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    I had some things to talk about in class about the first test, so I'll say them here.
                                </p>
                                <br/>

                                <p>
                                    The grades are posted, and I'm sure many of you are unhappy. Don't be alarmed, the test was hard! The average was around 70%, which is fairly low, but it was what I expected and I have planned accordingly.

                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>

                                    I'm introducing an optional test correction assignment for half-credit (for this and the next test, but not the third). When you check your grade on blackboard, you'll be able to see 'learner feedback'. In there I've listed the questions that you got wrong on the test. Your optional assignment is to go through the questions, figure out what the correct answer was, and hand them in on blackboard. For each question you correct, you will receive a half mark added to your test grade. For some, this is a huge boost in your test grade. For example, if you received 60%, you can pull that mark up to 80%.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    The assignment MUST follow this specific format:

                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    1. Type the question out in full and include the question number.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    2. Type out the answer in full including the letter answer
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>

                                    I think this is more than fair (generous even). More importantly however, this is an opportunity to learn from your mistakes. Take the time to figure out what the correct answer was and figure out why the alternatives were wrong. I will put up an official assignment with the questions from the test. Again, this is NOT mandatory. It is an optional assignment. I will give you two weeks from today to hand this assignment in on blackboard. I will not accept late submissions. Enjoy the snow day!
                                </p>

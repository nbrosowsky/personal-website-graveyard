                                    Each student will write a QALMRI for every Student Presentation class period when they are not presenting (total of 11). There are 4 articles for each week, and you must choose ONE of the articles to write a QALMRI on. Students who are presenting are not required to write a QALMRI for that week. QALMRI's are worth 20% of the course grade. Out of the 11 QALMRIs, only 10 will be counted towards your grade. They are graded out of 5 points. Full grades will be given to those who hand in their assignment on time and provide all the required content for the QALMRI. QALMRIs are due the day before class at 11:59 pm and must be submitted on blackboard. Fails are given to students who do not hand in their assignment on time.

                                </p>
                                <br />

                                <p>
                                    <strong>DUE DATES:</strong> QALMRIs are always due the day before class at 11:59 pm and must be submitted on blackboard.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Late QALMRIs will not be accepted</strong> and are grounds for an automatic fail for that QALMRI. The articles are posted in advance, so there is no excuse for handing in late assignments.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Purpose of the QALMRI</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Writing weekly QALMRIs will help you comprehend the empirical papers that you read on a weekly basis. Empirical papers contain a lot of information and it requires practice to extract the central important questions that are being asked, and the main findings that are being reported.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    QALMRI is an acronym. It stands for the following components of empirical papers: What are the broad and specific questions?, what were the alternative hypotheses, what was the logic of the design, what was the method, what were the results, what inferences about the specific and broad question can be made from the results, what’s the next question?
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    QALMRI is a guide to focus your reading so that you can identify these aspects of the articles you read. If you can clearly identify all of these aspects of a journal article, then you are on your way to comprehending the research you read about. The best way to ensure your comprehension is complete is write it out. This is why you will write a weekly QALMRI summary on the papers.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Assignment</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each week you will write a one-page QALMRI for any one of the research papers being presented that week. The papers for each class presentation are listed on the class schedule page. You can pick from among any of these papers. If a paper presented more than one experiment, you may do the QALMRI for one particular experiment.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    Writing a QALMRI for any research paper is simply writing short answers to each of these questions using clear and concise language. It is a condensed, short-form, version of the research. You should think of this as an efficient way to summarize the paper. If someone hadn’t read the paper, they should be able to get the gist of the paper from your QALMRI.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    <strong>*For a more in-depth description and explanation of how to approach a QALMRI, see the “How to use the QALMRI method” pdf posted above.</strong>

                                    To be even more specific, your task is to answer these questions for the paper that you read:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Question:</strong> What was the broad question? What was the specific question?

                                    <strong>Logic:</strong>If hypothesis #1 was true, what was the predicted outcome? What was the predicted outcome if hypothesis #2 was true?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Methods:</strong> What was the experimental design and the methods used in the experiment(s)?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Results:</strong>What was the pattern of data? What was the main finding?

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Inferences:</strong>What can be concluded about the hypotheses based on the data? What can be concluded about the specific and broad question?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Connecting to course content:</strong> In what ways does this article connect to the content in this weeks chapter?
                                </p>
                                <br />

                                    How long is a QALMRI? Long enough to answer each question with clear and brief sentences. Should be about one-page (single-spaced).

                                    You should use Power Point (or a similar program) to create slides that you will use during your presentation. You should include graphs and figures from your primary research article.

                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    Follow these tips to help you create a successful presentation. A first tip is to break up your presentation into units of time. Presentations are stories, they have a beginning a middle and end. You have about 3.3 minutes for each section. Let's see how this breaks down.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Introduction section (about 3 minutes)</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The introduction starts with the big idea and narrows down to the specific experimental hypothesis being tested in your article. You might devote a first slide for describing the big idea with respect to the real-world. This will help the audience understand the question of interest. You should then have a slide that describes any necessary background knowledge. Is there a fact(s) that is important for the audience to know that inspired the present experiments? You should have a slide that presents the specific hypotheses that are under investigation.

                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Methods Section (about 3 minutes)</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The methods section should clearly show how the experimental procedure is used to test the hypotheses under investigation. It is not necessary to present loads of unnecessary information. It is important to communicate the main factors that were manipulated (the independent variables), and the main measures that were collected (the dependent variable). It is most important to communicate what the subjects did in the experiment. This is usually accomplished with visual aids that give example of what subjects did on each trial of the experiment.

                                    If you have communicated the hypotheses and the experimental design clearly, then the audience should have a good idea about what the authors predicted for their findings. It is often helpful to create a slide for predicted results before showing the actual results. Next, it is most important to present the data. This will usually be figure or graph from the paper. These can be copied and pasted directly into your presentation from the electronic .pdf. You should clearly describe the pattern of data, and what the authors considered to be the most important finding. During class, you should spend time walking the class through the graph (e.g., what are the axes on the graphs, what do different colors mean, what does the graph show). In the discussion section you should clearly state how the finding relates back to the hypotheses under investigation. In other words, what inferences can be made about these results. You should end your discussion with some comments about the broader implications of the findings. Why are these findings important? What are some flaws? What are some next questions?

                                    You presentation should include information about the Question, Alternatives, Logic, Methods, Results, Inferences, and next Questions (QALMRI) about the experiment (see handout). Identifying these items provides a means for critically evaluating experiments, as well as for organizing your own experiment proposals. It helps you to find connections between theory and data by making explicit the question being asked, the approach used to answer it, and the implications of the answer.
                                    <strong>Remember that your overall goal is to explain the article to the class – not just to identify the parts of QALMRI.</strong> QALMRI is supposed to guide you to make sure you cover all the important parts.

                                    Your presentation is worth 15% of your total grade.

                                    It is expected that at the beginning of the course not all students will understand how to create and deliver a good presentation that communicates the major ideas and findings from an empirical article.
                                    <strong>Thus, students who sign up for the early slots will be graded more leniently than later slots.</strong> It is expected that the quality of presentations will improve across the semester.

                                    The presentation will be graded along two basic dimensions: content and communication.

                                    A good presentation will contain all of the elements of the QALMRIQ. The presenter will introduce appropriate background information, clearly describe the overall research question, and the more specific question under investigation. The presenter will show the main hypotheses and logic of the study. The presenter will clearly describe the methods. The presenter will clearly describe the results and link the results back to the hypotheses under investigation. The presenter will discuss the significance of the findings, and may even describe some pitfalls and next questions.

                                    The presenter will use a clear and audible speaking voice. The slides will not contain too much text. Major aspects of the content will be clearly displayed using simple and appropriate labels or headings. The presentation will be engaging. The presentation will be constructed to last 10 minutes in length, and not more.

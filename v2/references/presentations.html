    <p> The goal of the current study was to use traditional learning procedures to examine how learning processes might participate in the adjustment of selective attention processing. Across three experiments, we found that participants could
      learn to ignore a particular word in a Stroop task, eliminating the traditional interference effect. However, in all three experiments the interference effect re-appeared when the trained items were intermixed with untrained items, demonstrating
      a consistent failure of transfer. </p>

        </p></span>
    <p> Gratton effects refer to the finding in selective attention tasks (e.g., Stroop, Flanker) that interference effects (incongruent minus congruent RTs) are smaller on trials immediately following an incongruent than congruent trial. Gratton
      effects are commonly explained by transient or reactive conflict-­induced shifts in attentional weights on trial n-­1 that carry forward to influence trial n. Separately from this short-­term influence episodic memory traces may also bind
      together attentional control settings associated with features of particular items that could allow for longer-­term cue-­driven reinstatement of prior attentional settings. In three related experiments, participants completed a color-­identification
      flanker task. Colors were presented on different images, and specific images were paired with congruent or incongruent trial types. We found that re-­presenting an image 4-­8 trials later modulated congruency effects on an item-­specific,
      and longer-­term basis than the traditional Gratton effect.

        Spain.  </p></span>
    <p> Hierarchical theories of action planning in skilled domains like typing (Logan & Crump, 2011) have proposed a distinction between inner and outer loop control processes that represent higher-order planning (outer loop) processes and lower-level
      motor execution (inner loop) processes. Specifically, the outer loop control processes retrieve words as plans, and serves word-level representations to the inner loop, which then translates them to individual keystrokes at the letter
      level. A critical implication of the dual-loop theory is that typists rely on verbal processes to control serial-ordering between finger movements. The current study tests the role of verbal processes in controlling fluent typing in three
      tasks manipulating verbal processing during typing. In Experiments 1 and 2, we demonstrate that typists type faster if they speak the words rather than letters. Experiments 3 and 4 show typing performance is worse under conditions where
      verbal processing is disrupted. In Experiment 3, typing was disrupted under several conditions of verbal suppression and in Experiment 4, under conditions of delayed auditory feedback. Taken together, these results provide supporting evidence
      for the dual-loop hierarchical control theory and suggests a role for verbal processes in the control of fluent typing.

    <p> Crump &amp; Milliken (2009) showed that Stroop effects can be modulated by context-specific cues associated with different levels of proportion congruent, even for items that appeared equally frequently in each context. This result has important theoretical
    implications, because it ruled out frequency-driven learning explanations of context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) effects, and left open the possibility that cue-driven retrieval process can reinstate attentional control setting in a rapid
    online fashion. The purpose of the present work was to address reproducibility concerns that have been raised about this finding. We conducted several replications and novels extensions of the Crump &amp; Milliken procedures using Amazon’s mechanical
    Turk in both Stroop and flanker tasks. We successfully replicated the major findings from prior work, and conducted new analyses of the role of sequential influences on CSPC effects that showed a critical role for context repetitions in CSPC flanker
    effects, but not in CSPC Stroop effects. We also provide new monte-carlo simulation analyses to estimate reproducibility of the phenomena that show important limitations on these designs for measuring contextual control.

    <p> 	Context has been shown to cue the automatic reinstatement of various psychological processes across domains. The current study investigates context-dependency in a previously unexamined aspect of cognitive control: the creation and execution of stimulus-response
      sets. Specifically, we investigate whether response subsets can become associated with, and retrieved by contextual cues. Over three choice reaction time experiments we found no evidence for contextual control over stimulus-response sets.

    <p> 	The contextual properties of the environment, through learning and memory processes, can rapidly and involuntarily adjust attentional control (Chun, 2000; Corballis &amp; Gratton, 2003; Crump, Gong, &amp; Milliken, 2006; Crump, Vaquero, &amp; Milliken,
    2008). Still, little is know about the conditions under which contextual cueing occurs. The current study explores the obligatory nature of contextual cueing, specifically examining the role of volition in acquiring context-dependent attenitonal control.
    Using an attentional sampling task with location cues and proportion manipulations, Experiments 1 and 2 failed to find evidence of context dependency. In Experiment 3, participants adopted voluntary, context-dependent attention strategies and demonstrated
    successful context discrimination. Experiment 4 disentangles the roles of volition and contextual learning and provides some evidence for context-dependent attentional control. Taken together, these experiments challenge the obligatory nature of contextual
    cueing and demonstrate a case where volition is required to learn contextual contingencies.

    <p> 		Cognitive control refers to a collection of processes responsible for planning, monitoring, and adjusting behavior. In the domain of attention, one important aspect of cognitive control is the ability to selectively process task-relevant from irrelevant
      information. Historically, researchers have made the distinction between automatic processes that capture attention involuntarily and strategic, voluntary processes that shift attention in accordance with top-down goals (Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975;
      Shiffrin &amp; Schneider, 1977). However, more recent evidence has demonstrated that contextual properties of the environment, through learning and memory processes, can rapidly and involuntarily adjust attentional control settings; a kind of “automatic
      attentional control”. (Chun, 2000; Cohen, Fuchs, Bar-Sela, Brumberg, &amp; Magen, 1999; Corballis &amp; Gratton, 2003; Crump, Gong, &amp; Milliken, 2006; Crump, Vaquero, &amp; Milliken, 2008). Still, relatively little is known about the conditions
      under which contextual cuing occurs. The purpose of the current project is to investigate the constraints of context-specific attentional control.

    </p></span>
    <p> 			Three experiments are reported in which the attentional capture effect of sound disappearance was assessed. In all experiments participants were required to judge the pitch of target sounds that were preceded by one or more context sounds. In Experiments
        1 and 2, targets presented in the same location as a context sound that had abruptly terminated 100 ms before its presentation, were identified better than target sounds presented in a different location. This result was obtained both when targets
        followed a single context sound (Experiment 1) and when targets followed pairs of dichotically-presented context sounds that terminated at different points (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 3 replicated those obtained in the previous experiments
        and showed that under some conditions the facilitative effect could persist at intervals longer than 100 ms. The results of these experiments suggest that under some conditions, the disappearance of a sound can capture attention.

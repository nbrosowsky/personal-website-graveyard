    <p> Recent work suggests that environmental cues associated with previous attentional control settings can rapidly and involuntarily adjust attentional priorities. The current study tests predictions from adaptive-learning and memory-based theories
      of contextual control about the role of intentions for setting attentional priorities. To extend the empirical boundaries of contextual control phenomena, and to determine whether theoretical principles of contextual control are generalizable
      we used a novel bi-dimensional stimulus sampling task. Subjects viewed briefly presented arrays of letters and colors presented above or below fixation, and identified specific stimuli according to a dimensional (letter or color) and positional
      cue. Location was predictive of the cued dimension, but not the position or identity. In contrast to previous findings, contextual control failed to develop through automatic, adaptive-learning processes. Instead, previous experience with
      intentionally changing attentional sampling priorities between different contexts was required for contextual control to develop.

    <p> Although visual demonstrations of multistability are ubiquitous, there are few auditory examples. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether simultaneously presented melodies, such as underlie the scale illusion (Deutsch,
      1975), can elicit multiple mutually exclusive percepts, and whether reported perceptions are mediated by musical expertise. Participants listened to target melodies and reported whether the target was embedded in subsequent test melodies.
      Target sequences were created such that they would only be heard if the listener interpreted the test melody according to various perceptual cues. Critically, and in contrast with previous examinations of the scale illusion, an objective
      measure of target detection was obtained by including target-absent test melodies. As a result, listeners could reliably identify target sequences from different perceptual organizations when presented with the same test melody on different
      trials. This result demonstrates an ability to alternate between mutually exclusive percepts of an unchanged stimulus. However, only perceptual organizations consistent with frequency and spatial cues were available and musical expertise
      did mediate target detection, limiting the organizations available to non-musicians. The current study provides the first known demonstration of auditory multistability using simultaneously presented melodies and provides a unique experimental
      method for measuring auditory perceptual competition.

    <p> Crump &amp; Milliken (2009) showed that Stroop effects can be modulated by context-specific cues associated with different levels of proportion congruent, even for items that appeared equally frequently in each context. This result has important
      theoretical implications, because it ruled out frequency-driven learning explanations of context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) effects, and left open the possibility that a cue-driven retrieval process can reinstate attentional
      control setting in a rapid online fashion. The purpose of the present work was to address reproducibility concerns that have been raised about this finding (Hutcheon &amp; Spieler, under review). We conducted several reproductions and
      novel extensions of the Crump &amp; Milliken procedures using Amazon&#39;s mechanical Turk in both Stroop and flanker tasks. We successfully replicated the major findings from prior work. We also provide new Monte Carlo simulation analyses
      to estimate reproducibility of the phenomena that show important limitations on these designs for measuring contextual control.

  <p> Three experiments are reported in which the attentional capture effect of sound disappearance was assessed. In all experiments participants were required to judge the pitch of target sounds that were preceded by one or more context sounds.
    In Experiments 1 and 2, targets presented in the same location as a context sound that had abruptly terminated 100 ms before its presentation, were identified better than target sounds presented in a different location. This result was obtained
    both when targets followed a single context sound (Experiment 1) and when targets followed pairs of dichotically-presented context sounds that terminated at different points (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 3 replicated those obtained
    in the previous experiments and showed that under some conditions the facilitative effect could persist at intervals longer than 100 ms. The results of these experiments suggest that under some conditions, the disappearance of a sound can
    capture attention.

							<h3>My Teaching Philosophy</h3>
						</div>
						<div>
							Before I made the leap into academia I was a musician and music instructor. I taught weekly 30-minute music lessons with upwards of 50 students a week. I was very young when I started teaching music, only 17-years-old, and I have to admit I knew very
							little about how to teach. For the first number of years I tried to develop my “style” of teaching and tried to create some formal series of lesson plans that could be used for every student. It was during these formative years that I began to
							understand the true diversity of student needs: no two students are the same. Each comes to every lesson with their own unique experiences with fundamentally different learning histories, motivations, strengths and weaknesses. These challenging
							and rewarding experiences have been foundational in my development as an instructor. As I reflect back, and begin to think about my future as a post-secondary instructor, there are several overarching goals that stand out and help define my teaching
							philosophy:
						</div>
						<br />
						<div>
							<strong>Foster an appreciation for psychology as a science (and make it memorable).</strong><br /> In many ways teaching psychology is an uphill battle. Students arrive with their own preconceived notions not only about the field of psychology
							broadly but about specific psychological theories and constructs. Before any student has picked up a textbook they have beliefs about how memory works, what “attention” is, gender differences, and learning strategies, for example. As a psychologist,
							researcher, and instructor I want to provide them with a well-informed view of the science of psychology and demonstrate the relevance of psychological concepts to their own personal lives. I invite students to utilize their own unique life experiences
							while learning the course material and try to illustrate the applicability of psychological principles to broader personal, social, and cultural issues. For example, I try to always introduce a new topic by providing relevant examples students
							can relate to, and highlight the practical goals of understanding a particular topic. My choice of student assessments also reflects this broader goal. Although I use more traditional assessments like tests, students are also given written assignments
							to reflect on psychological concepts and theories and try to apply them more broadly to their own lives.
						</div>
						<br />
						<div>
							<strong>Develop and sharpen critical thinking skills </strong><br /> One of the most important skills I can teach a student, and one of the most difficult to learn, is critical thinking. As an instructor I believe I should be encouraging students
							to be curious and inquisitive, creating an environment that allows for creativity and spontaneous discovery. To achieve this goal, students must learn to examine their preconceived notions, challenge the assumptions underlying arguments, and ground
							their own arguments in psychological science. My teaching strategy has tended to move away from a lecturing format, instead trying to facilitate and lead discussion-style lessons. In this way, students are encouraged to ask questions and reason
							through problems out loud. Often having students take time to reflect on the question either individually or in small groups to prepare a short written response is helpful in getting all the students involved in the larger discussion. The diversity
							of learning styles also requires some diversity in teaching methods. It is important to me as an instructor that I am flexible in terms of utilizing different methods (small group discussions, full-class discussions, online discussions, etc.) to
							account for this diversity and allow each student an equal opportunity for learning. I also think that scientific writing assignments are useful in having students to synthesize material with my assessment focused more on the logical arguments
							and progression of ideas rather than content exclusively. When I give students these written assignments I give them a detailed rubric that focuses on critical thinking and the logical placement and structure of their arguments. It is also important
							to me that I provide as much constructive feedback as possible and structure assignments in such a way that allows students to demonstrate improvement over the semester.
						</div>
						<br />
						<div>

							<strong>Cultivate scientific literacy</strong> <br />
							Coming from an experimental psychology tradition, I have a particular interest in improving the scientific literacy of my students. This skill is especially important with the overwhelming amount of information available
							and prevalence of ‘pop’ science. I approach this goal in two different ways. The first is to provide students with tools necessary to find and assess scientific evidence. This involves teaching students to read empirical studies and identify logical
							arguments being made by the author and how they are being assessed. This is a tall order and requires that we use methods that help scaffold the students learning. For example, I have had students learn to read empirical articles by having them
							summarize important information from the articles using a structured format that encourages students to think critically about the questions being asked, how they are evaluated, and how they were answered (the QALMRI method, Kosslyn & Rosenberg,
							2001). Another approach I use is to examine how researchers have approached scientific problems in the past. One particular activity I think is useful is having students participate in an experiment that demonstrates a psychological phenomenon
							like attentional blindness or false memory and attempt to backwards engineer the purpose. For example, following the experiment students break into groups and try to put themselves into the experimenter’s shoes to determine why they would want
							to run that experiment, what you could learn, what are the questions being asked, and what are the possible answers.
